# Objective Revision Evaluation Service
A webserver for hosting scoring services.

# Installation

## Vagrant
The recommended installation is to set up Vagrant and VirtualBox, then `cd ores` and run:

* `vagrant up`

## Or, the hard way!
If you want to install by hand, follow the installation instructions for
[revscoring](https://github.com/wiki-ai/revscoring/blob/master/README.rst#installation),
especially the package installation.  Please note that your setup will probably not
be perfectly compatible with our development and production platforms.  Consider
using the Vagrant method, above.

Install ORES like any other python module, for example:

* `sudo pip3 install ores`

## Configuration
TODO:

* Point me at local wiki.

## Running
TODO:

* How to start the service.
* How to trigger it.
* How to see results.
